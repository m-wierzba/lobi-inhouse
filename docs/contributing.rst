Contributing to the Docs
========================

Help files are written in reStructuredText format and the website is generated by `Sphinx <http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/>`_. See `Getting Started with Sphinx <https://docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/intro/getting-started-with-sphinx.html>`_ from readthedocs for a great introduction.

You can edit the .rst files to change the documentation.
